# Documentation - the go-to place to learn toddle
At toddle, youâ€™ll find a new way to build software. Reliable, different, and incredibly powerful software. Learn how and help change how software is built.

## What is Toddle?

toddle is an open-source web application framework for creating highly-performant web apps.

Use toddle to develop software in a visual development environment.

Connect any backend, build pixel-perfect UIs, set up complex workflows, transform data via formulas, add custom code, and perform CRUD operations and authentication via API request.

Collaborate with branching and version control. Build with a component-based architecture, connect domains, and let toddle host and ship server-side rendered web apps or components.

Projects are cloneable, and community-built packages are free! People have made amazing apps and have great stories to share.

If you can build it in React, you can build it in toddle. We went as far as building toddle in toddle!
