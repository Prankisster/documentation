# First week in toddle

Welcome to your first week in toddle. Every new tool has a learning curve; the best way to learn new tools or technologies is to play with them.
toddle is a professional tool with many bells and whistles, and it will take some time to learn the full extent of its capabilities. 
The good news is that it only takes about a week to learn the basic concepts.

We have prepared a series of videos for you to learn during your first week in toddle. 
We recommend you open these videos in a window next to the toddle editor and use the video as a reference as you build. 
It's a great way to use the tool without suffering from the blank canvas syndrome.
